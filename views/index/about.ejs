        <p class="abstract"><strong>NESTSCOUT</strong> helps the users to make good decisions regarding buying or selling of valuable property. Prior
            to this online system this process involved a lot of travelling costs and searching time. Due to this system
            the user now does not have to travel much and can look for the property it is searching for, online
            according to its requirements. This system includes property details like Address, space measurement (sq
            ft), number of BHKs, Floor, Property Seller name and its contact number plus email-id. The user can search
            property depending on the area that it wants in, number of wash rooms, bedrooms, halls and kitchen. The
            system contains an algorithm that calculates loan that the user can take plus 20%-30% cash that the user has
            to pay. This system allows the admin to enter details about any property that it is wishing for. The admin
            can even delete the property details. Thus this system eliminates cost to a great extent and also reduces
            searching time. With the help of this system the user can get the property details depending on its
            preferences. Thus this system also helps to maintain good relationship between the buyers and the sellers of
            the property.</p>
